    "3. `distance_to_train_stat` - column is populated with values containing the direct distance from the closest train station to the property that has a direct trip to the Southern Cross Railway Station. \n",
    "4. `travel_min_to_CBD` - column is populated with values containing the average travel time in minutes from the closest train station (regional/metropolitan) that has a direct trip to the \"Southern Cross Railway Station on weekdays (i.e. Monday-Frida) **departing** between 7 to 9:30 am. \n",
    "5. `over_priced?` - column is populated with values containing a boolean feature indicating whether or not the price of the property is higher than the median price of the similar properties (with respect to bedrooms, bathrooms, parking_space, and property_type attributes) in the same suburb on the year of selling. \n",
    "6. `crime_A_average` - column is populated with values containing the average of type A crime for three years prior to selling **in the local government area** of the property as the property. \n",

    "Thus, is can be observed that there's a strong linear relationship between the attribute **Rooms** and the target variable **Price**, thus, no normalisation/transformation methods will be applied on the **Rooms** attribute. Normalisation is not considered because for a linear model the linear regression coefficients will be identical if you do, or don't, scale your data, because it's looking at proportional relationships between them. Thus, it's not necessary to perform normalisation, as it's utilisied to normalize residuals by transforming non-linear data to reach linearity. However, from the scatter plot there's already a strong relationship between the dependent and independent variables which in this instance is **Rooms** and **Price**. Therefore, it was deemed not appropriate to perform any normalizations on **Rooms** attribute. Additionally, transformations is utilised either:\n",

    "Firstly, for the **Rooms** attribute it was conclude that no normalisation/transformation is neccessary when building the linear model for Price as it can be observed from scatter plot relationship between **Rooms** and **Price** there's a strong linear relationship between the attribute **Rooms** and the target variable **Price**, thus, no normalisation/transformation methods will be applied on the **Rooms** attribute. Normalisation is not considered because for a linear model the linear regression coefficients will be identical if you do, or don't, scale your data, because it's looking at proportional relationships between them. Thus, it's not necessary to perform normalisation, as it's utilisied to normalize residuals by transforming non-linear data to reach linearity. However, from the scatter plot there's already a strong relationship between the dependent and independent variables which in this instance is **Rooms** and **Price**. Therefore, it was deemed not appropriate to perform any normalizations on **Rooms** attribute. Additionally, transformations is utilised either:\n",
    "* to achieve linearity \n",
    "* to achieve homogeneity of variance, which is constant variance for the regession equation\n",
    "* to achieve normality (symmetry) for the regression equation \n",
    "However, as aformentioned as there's already strong linearity, hence, transformation is not required for **Rooms** attirbute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, for the attribute **crime_C_average** as the data was clustered to the left, the aim was to utilise square root transformation on the attribute **crime_C_average** to spread out the data, thus, creating a stronger linear relationship. Thus, the proposed transformation was successful in achieving a stronger linearity between the predictor **crime_C_average** and the target variable **Price**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, for the attribute **travel_min_to_CBD** there was a very weak relationship with the target variable **Price**. Thus, the decision was to user power transformations to adjust the values for **travel_min_to_CBD** to match the scale with the target variable **Price**, thus, creating a moderate linear relationship. From the scatterplot visualistion it can be observed that after the power transformation on the attribute **travel_min_to_CBD** a moderate relationship between the attribute and the target **Price** was been achieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, for the attribute **Age** and the target variable price **Price** there was a moderate linear relationship. Thus, the decision was made to user power transformations to adjust the values for **Age** which'll match the scale with the target variable **Price**, the, aim was to achieve a stronger linear relationship with the x-axis scale adjusted to a range between 0 - 5000000+.  From the output it can be observed that after the power transformation on the attribute **Age** a strong relationship between the attribute and the target **Price** was achieved. Therefore the power transformation by adjusting the values for **Age** to match the scale for the target variable price **Price**, was succesful in achieving a strong linear relationship against the target variable **Price** with the x-axis scale adjusted to a range between 0 - 5000000+.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the recommendation/proposal for building a linear model on **Price** with the four attributes **Rooms**, **Age**, **travel_min_to_CBD** and **crime_C_average** is no normalisation/tansformation is necessary for **Room** attribute, **square root transformation** for **crime_C_average** attribute, **power transformation** for **travel_min_to_CBD** attribute and **power transformation** for **Age** attribute. As these transformations have been tested and shown to have strong improvements in linearity, therefore, they're the proposed suggestion/recommendation for the appropriate data reshaping procedure when building the linear model for **Price**.
